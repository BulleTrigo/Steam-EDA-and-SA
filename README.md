# Steam Store Exploratory Data Analysis & Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis and sentiment analysis on the Steam Store dataset. The Steam Store is a popular digital distribution platform for video games, and this project will provide insights into the games available on the platform.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle and provides a comprehensive collection of information about games available on the Steam Store. It includes details such as game titles, genres, release dates, user reviews, pricing, publishers, developers, and more. The dataset will be preprocessed and analyzed to extract meaningful insights.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In the exploratory data analysis phase, we will investigate several key areas of the Steam Store dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of the games available on the platform. The key areas we will explore include:

- Distribution of game genres: We will analyze the distribution of different game genres to identify the most popular genres on the Steam Store.
- Game release patterns: We will examine the release patterns of games to identify any trends or seasonality in the game releases.
- Pricing analysis: We will analyze the pricing information of games to understand the pricing strategies employed on the Steam Store.
- Publishers analysis: We will explore the publishers' information to identify the most prolific publishers on the platform.
- Developers analysis: We will analyze the developers' information to identify the most active and successful game developers on the Steam Store.
- Distribution of game categories: We will investigate the distribution of games across different categories to understand the variety and focus of games available.

These analyses will provide us with valuable insights into the games available on the Steam Store, their characteristics, and the market dynamics.
## Sentiment Analysis

To gauge the sentiment of user reviews, we will perform sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques. By analyzing the textual content of the reviews, we can classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. This sentiment analysis will provide us with an overall understanding of the sentiment towards different games and help identify user preferences and sentiments associated with specific genres or publishers.
